## EIP-7528: Standardizing ETH Handling in EVM

In the ever-evolving Ethereum ecosystem, developers and protocols constantly seek ways to improve efficiency, standardization, and interoperability. A proposed standard, **EIP-7528**, addresses the unique treatment of ETH, the native currency of Ethereum, suggesting a standardized mechanism for handling it akin to ERC-20 tokens without requiring conversion to Wrapped Ether (WETH). Here, we’ll take a closer look at the motivations, technical considerations, and potential benefits of this proposal for both developers and users.

### Understanding the Need for EIP-7528

At its core, EIP-7528 proposes a universal approach for handling ETH on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as if it were an ERC-20 token. Typically, the Ethereum network treats ETH differently from ERC-20 tokens, primarily because it is not issued by a smart contract and doesn’t follow the ERC-20 protocol. As a result, integrating ETH into systems that assume ERC-20 compatibility often requires additional logic or the use of WETH, which wraps ETH into an ERC-20 compatible token.

EIP-7528 introduces a **“pseudo address”** that can stand in for ETH, allowing it to be treated as if it were an ERC-20 token without needing conversion. This pseudo address is designated as `0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee`, representing ETH in smart contracts and applications in the same way an ERC-20 token would be represented.

---

### Key Highlights of EIP-7528

* **Unified ETH Representation:** ETH can be represented by the pseudo address `0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee`, which allows developers to treat ETH transactions and ERC-20 transactions similarly, eliminating the need for special handling of ETH in certain contexts.
* **Consistency Across Applications:** With a unified representation, smart contracts can interact with ETH and ERC-20 tokens interchangeably, making it easier for developers to write cross-compatible code and reducing the risk of errors due to disparate logic for ETH.
* **Gas Efficiency Improvements:** Avoiding the need to convert ETH to WETH can help reduce gas costs, which is beneficial in scenarios where gas optimization is critical, such as high-frequency transactions or applications involving large volumes of transactions.
* **Applicability Beyond Ethereum:** The standard is designed to be compatible with other EVM-based chains. For instance, on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the native asset BNB could also use this same pseudo address, as could MATIC on Polygon, providing a consistent approach to native asset handling across EVM chains.

### Motivation Behind EIP-7528

The driving motivation of EIP-7528 is to streamline the treatment of ETH and ERC-20 tokens in a way that is both gas-efficient and developer-friendly. With the current infrastructure, ETH requires special handling due to its unique status as a non-ERC-20 token. WETH partially addresses this by “wrapping” ETH in an ERC-20 compliant token, allowing it to interact with protocols designed to handle ERC-20 tokens. However, WETH still involves additional gas fees and steps, leading to inefficiencies.

By introducing a pseudo address for ETH, EIP-7528 allows developers to treat ETH as a fungible, ERC-20-like asset without converting it. This pseudo address simplifies code and reduces the risk of fragmented data when recording transactions, as developers can log events for both ETH and ERC-20 tokens in a consistent format.

#### Application Examples

* **Event Logging:** Use `0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee` in events for ETH-related transactions.
* **Asset Identification:** Enables standardized handling in protocols such as ERC-4626-based liquid staking tokens (LSTs).
* **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** Brings consistency in native asset handling across EVM-compatible chains like BSC and Polygon.

### ERC-4626 and Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)

One particularly promising application of this proposal is within the context of **ERC-4626**, a standard defining the interface for tokenized financial vaults. Liquid staking tokens (LSTs), which allow users to stake assets while retaining liquidity, are a natural fit for this ERC standard.

* **Standardized Interfaces:** Enables seamless operations like deposit and withdraw using ETH directly.
* **Increased Liquidity and Accessibility:** No WETH wrapping needed — better UX for staking ETH.
* **Protocol Interoperability:** Enhances interaction between protocols using ERC-4626 vaults.

---

### Security Considerations

Using ETH directly introduces potential **re-entrancy vulnerabilities**. Developers should follow the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern:

* **Checks:** Validate conditions before proceeding.
* **Effects:** Update the contract’s internal state.
* **Interactions:** Call external contracts last.

### Considered Alternatives for the Pseudo Address

Alternatives like `0x0`, `0x1`, and `0xe` were considered but rejected due to collision risks with Ethereum precompiled contracts and lack of clarity. The chosen address `0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee` is recognizable and avoids these issues.

---

### Benefits for Off-Chain Data Processing

EIP-7528 simplifies data processing by unifying ETH and ERC-20 logic. This allows for better indexing, transaction analysis, and consistency in analytics tools and dashboards, benefiting developers and data providers alike.

---

### Implications for Interoperability and Ecosystem Growth

Standardizing native assets like ETH across EVM-compatible chains promotes broader adoption, easier integration, and improved developer experience. It could also encourage other chains to adopt similar standards.

---

### Conclusion: A Step Toward Simplified, Unified Asset Handling

EIP-7528 represents a forward-thinking approach to treating native assets on EVM chains as fungible tokens within a standardized framework. By addressing the current limitations in handling ETH and other native assets, this proposal aims to create a seamless experience for developers and users, reducing complexity, optimizing gas costs, and enhancing security.

If widely adopted, EIP-7528 could contribute to the growth and evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem by offering an innovative, consistent approach to asset management.
