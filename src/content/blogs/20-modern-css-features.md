The last couple of years have been incredible for **CSS**. There have been so many new features that have come out, and they’re absolute **game changers** for how I write CSS.

So in this article, I’m going to be sharing with you my **20 favorite CSS features** rapid fire, so you can get as much information as quickly as possible. And if you want to go deeper on any of these, definitely check out their docs on **MDN**; almost every one of them is worth learning inside and out.

Let’s dive in!

---

## 1. `@layer`: Specifity Control

**`@layer`** is honestly one of my favorite CSS features ever. It’s been out for a while now, but not many people use it, and they really should. It lets you **create layers of specificity** in your CSS.

You can define something like:
```css
@layer reset, theme, defaults, layout, components, utils;

@layer reset {
  * { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
}

@layer theme {
  :root {
    --accent: #4f46e5;
  }
}

@layer utils {
  * {
    color: red;
  }
}
````

Because **`utils`** comes after **`components`** (or anything else), **it will always win**, even if the selectors are technically less specific. You can even **import directly into a layer**: `@import url("theme.css") layer(theme);`. Super powerful, and super underrated.

-----

## 2\. `text-wrap: balance`

Ever seen a heading with **one awkward word on its own line**? **`text-wrap: balance`** fixes that in one line.

```css
h1 {
  text-wrap: balance;
}
```

It balances text across lines as evenly as possible. So instead of:

*Super Long Heading With One Word Alone*

You get:

*Super Long Heading With One Word Alone*

Cleaner. Prettier. Easier to read.

-----

## 3\. CSS Nesting

**Nesting is finally in CSS** — no preprocessor needed. It lets you write cleaner, more structured styles.

```css
.main-title {
  font-size: 2rem;

  @media (min-width: 800px) {
    font-size: 3rem;
  }

  &.red {
    color: red;
  }

  .subtitle {
    font-size: 1.25rem;
  }
}
```

It’s like SCSS, but native.

-----

## 4\. Container Queries

Container Queries solve a **huge problem**: They let you style components based on their **container’s size**, not the viewport size.

```css
.card {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 450px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}

@container (max-width: 449px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

Perfect for component-based frameworks like React. No more media query chaos.

-----

## 5\. Relative Colors

**Relative Colors** let you **calculate new colors based on existing ones**.

```css
.button {
  --bg: oklch(70% 0.2 250);
  background: var(--bg);
  border: 2px solid color-mix(in oklch, var(--bg) 85%, black);
}

.button:hover {
  background: color-mix(in oklch, var(--bg) 92.5%, black);
}
```

You can also convert between color spaces (like `hsl` → `oklch`) on the fly. Massively useful for theme systems.

-----

## 6\. `:has()` (Parent Selector)

**`:has()`** is basically the **parent selector we’ve always wanted**.

```css
.input-group:has(input:valid) {
  border-color: green;
}

.input-group:has(input:invalid) {
  border-color: red;
}
```

This lets you style **a parent based on its children**. It’s so good, and it’s supported in every major browser now.

-----

## 7\. `@property`

Custom properties are great, but they don’t animate by default. **`@property`** fixes that by letting you **define type, inheritance, and defaults**.

```css
@property --my-color {
  syntax: '<color>';
  inherits: false;
  initial-value: red;
}

.box {
  --my-color: red;
  background: var(--my-color);
  transition: --my-color 0.5s;
}

.box:hover {
  --my-color: green;
}
```

This makes custom props **type-safe and animatable**.

-----

## 8\. Subgrid

**Subgrid** took forever to arrive, but it’s finally here and amazing. It lets a child grid **inherit the tracks from its parent grid**.

```css
.parent {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 2rem;
}

.child {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
  gap: inherit;
}
```

No more hand-syncing track sizes.

-----

## 9\. Multi-Value `display`

You can now define **outer and inner display separately**.

```css
.box {
  display: inline flex;
}
```

  * **`inline`** = how it lays itself out (outer)
  * **`flex`** = how it lays out children (inner)

It’s the clean way to combine layout behaviors going forward.

-----

## 10\. `display: contents`

This one’s sneaky but super useful. It **makes a wrapper element disappear visually** while keeping its styles.

```css
.wrapper {
  display: contents;
}
```

It lets the wrapper’s children behave like direct children of the flex/grid parent, perfect for fixing weird flexbox gap issues.

-----

## 11\. Logical Properties

**Logical properties** are just **direction-aware versions of physical properties**.

```css
.box {
  padding-inline-start: 1rem; /* instead of padding-left */
  margin-block-end: 2rem; /* instead of margin-bottom */
}
```

They **respect writing modes and language direction**, so your site works in RTL or vertical text automatically.

-----

## 12\. `::backdrop`

The **`::backdrop`** pseudo-element lets you **style the background of a `<dialog>`**.

```css
dialog::backdrop {
  background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
  backdrop-filter: blur(4px);
}
```

Add some fade animations and you’ve got beautiful modals.

-----

## 13\. `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` and 14. `@starting-style`

These two work hand-in-hand for **animating things that normally can’t animate**, like `display`.

```css
@starting-style {
  dialog[open] {
    opacity: 0;
    scale: 0.8;
  }
}

dialog[open] {
  transition: opacity .3s, scale .3s;
  transition-behavior: allow-discrete;
  opacity: 1;
  scale: 1;
}
```

Still missing in Firefox, but awesome for progressive enhancement.

-----

## 15\. `field-sizing: content`

This one is so cool: it lets **textareas grow with content**, no JS needed.

```css
textarea {
  field-sizing: content;
}
```

Only Chromium supports it right now, but it doesn’t break anything elsewhere. Great little progressive enhancement.

-----

## 16\. `@scope`

**`@scope`** lets you **scope styles to a specific subtree**, like CSS Modules, but native.

```css
@scope (.article) to (figure) {
  h2 {
    color: rebeccapurple;
  }
}
```

Or inline in a `<style>` tag:

```html
<section>
  <style scoped>
    h2 { color: rebeccapurple; }
  </style>
  <h2>Only this one is purple</h2>
</section>
```

Super handy for component libraries. (Still missing in Firefox.)

-----

## 17\. `anchor()` Positioning

This one is **my most hyped feature**. It lets you **position elements relative to other elements**, like real anchors.

```css
.anchor {
  anchor-name: --my-anchor;
}

.tooltip {
  position-anchor: --my-anchor;
  top: anchor(bottom);
  left: anchor(right);
}
```

The browser handles all the math. It’s still bleeding edge (no Firefox or Safari yet), but it’s going to be a game changer.

-----

## 18\. Container Style Queries

We saw size-based container queries earlier. This is similar, but lets you query **style values** inside a container.

```css
@container style(--accent: blue) {
  .card {
    border-color: var(--accent);
  }
}
```

It’s niche, but could be powerful for theme-based layouts later on.

-----

## 19\. `interpolate-size: allow-keywords`

Finally, we can **animate from `auto` or `max-content`**\!

```css
:root {
  interpolate-size: allow-keywords;
}

.panel {
  height: 2.5rem;
  transition: height .4s;
}

.panel:hover {
  height: max-content;
}
```

Normally this just jumps instantly; now it animates smoothly. So satisfying.

## 20\. The Future of CSS Is Here

That’s it, 20 modern CSS features that are **making writing CSS actually fun again**.

Some of them are ready for production right now, and others are perfect for progressive enhancement. Either way, they’re worth experimenting with, because they open up so many new possibilities.
