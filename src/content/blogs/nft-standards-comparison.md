## NFT Standards Comparison

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have transformed the digital landscape by allowing unique ownership and transfer of assets on the blockchain. Among the various NFT standards, ERC-721, ERC-721A, and ERC-1155 are the most widely adopted. Each standard serves distinct purposes and has unique features that suit different use cases.

In this blog, we will explore the key differences and advantages of these NFT standards. Now let’s start with recent NFT statistics.

### Recent NFT Market Statistics

- **Market Growth**: The NFT market was valued at $41 billion in 2021, with sales reaching $25 billion that year alone. Despite a recent decline, the market is projected to reach $80 billion by 2025.  
- **User Base**: The number of NFT users is expected to grow to 11.6 million by 2025.  
- **Sales Volume**: Weekly NFT sales typically range between $10 million and $20 million.

In this blog, we will delve into the key differences, advantages, and use cases of these NFT standards. It helps Ethereum remain the top blockchain for smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs.

Are you interested in implementing a token about a specific standard? Now let’s understand the NFT.

## Understanding NFT Standards

NFT standards define the rules and functionalities an NFT smart contract must follow. These standards ensure compatibility, security, and efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem. The following are the most widely used NFT standards:

- **ERC-721**: The original and most widely used standard for NFTs.  
- **ERC-721A**: A modification of ERC-721, designed for gas efficiency.  
- **ERC-1155**: A multi-token standard accepts both fungible and non-fungible tokens.

Now, let’s analyze each of these standards in detail.

## ERC-721: The First NFT Standard

ERC-721 was introduced by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs in 2018. It established the foundation for NFTs by enabling unique, non-fungible tokens with distinct properties.

### Key Features

- **Uniqueness**: Each ERC-721 token is distinct, with its unique ID.  
- **Ownership and Transferability**: Tokens can be transferred between users while preserving their uniqueness.  
- **Metadata Support**: Each token can have metadata that links to images, videos, or other assets.  
- **Marketplace Compatibility**: ERC-721 is widely supported by NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea and Rarible.

### Advantages of ERC-721

- **Established Standard**: ERC-721 is widely accepted and supported across blockchain platforms and NFT marketplaces.  
- **Unique Ownership & Scarcity**: Ensures that each token is one-of-a-kind, making it valuable for collectibles and digital assets.  
- **Security & Reliability**: The standard has been tested extensively, making it a secure option for NFT implementation.

### Popular Use Cases

- **Digital Art & Collectibles**: Artists create and sell unique digital artwork as NFTs on marketplaces like OpenSea.  
- **Gaming & Virtual Assets**: In-game items, characters, and virtual land can be tokenized and owned by players.  
- **Real Estate & Identity Verification**: NFTs can represent ownership of real-world assets or verify digital identities securely.

## ERC-721A: An Optimized Version of ERC-721

ERC-721A was introduced by the Azuki development team to address the high gas fees associated with ERC-721. It is particularly beneficial for projects that need to mint multiple NFTs at once.

### Key Features

- **Batch Minting**: Allows users to mint multiple NFTs in a single transaction, reducing gas fees.  
- **Optimized Storage**: Reduces redundant storage operations, making transactions more efficient.  
- **Backward Compatibility**: Fully compatible with existing ERC-721 marketplaces and wallets.

### Advantages of ERC-721A

- **Lower Gas Fees**: Batch minting significantly reduces transaction costs compared to ERC-721.  
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized data handling minimizes redundant storage operations, improving scalability.  
- **Maintains Security & Compatibility**: Preserves ERC-721’s uniqueness and security while remaining compatible with major marketplaces and wallets.

### Popular Use Cases

- **NFT Collections & Drops**: Ideal for projects minting large batches of NFTs, such as PFP (profile picture) collections.  
- **Gaming & Virtual Assets**: Enables cost-effective minting of in-game assets, such as weapons, skins, or characters.  
- **Event Tickets & Memberships**: Efficiently mints multiple tickets or membership passes in a single transaction.

## ERC-1155: A Multi-Token Standard

ERC-1155 was developed by Enjin as a more versatile token standard, allowing a single contract to manage multiple token types. This standard supports both fungible (e.g., ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (ERC-721) within the same contract.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Token Support**: Can manage multiple token types within a single contract.  
- **Batch Transfers**: Enables efficient transfers of multiple tokens in one transaction.  
- **Reduced Gas Costs**: More gas-efficient than ERC-721 for large-scale NFT collections.  
- **Shared Metadata**: Supports token IDs that share metadata templates.

### Advantages of ERC-1155

- **Versatile Token Management**: Supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract, making it ideal for diverse asset ecosystems.  
- **Efficient Batch Transactions**: Reduces gas fees by allowing multiple tokens to be transferred or minted in one transaction.  
- **Cost-Effective & Scalable**: More gas-efficient than ERC-721, making it suitable for large-scale NFT collections.

### Popular Use Cases

- **Blockchain Gaming**: Enables seamless management of in-game assets, including weapons, skins, and currencies.  
- **Digital Collectibles & Art**: Allows collections with varying rarities and editions to be managed under one contract.  
- **Loyalty & Reward Programs**: Businesses can issue fungible reward points alongside unique NFTs for special perks.
