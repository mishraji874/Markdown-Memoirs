## Networking Basics

Networking is the backbone of modern technology and is essential for connecting devices and services. In this article, you will learn about key concepts, terminology, and protocols used in networking.

### Terminology

Understanding common networking terms:

- **Connection**: Transfer of data through a network.  
- **Packet**: Smallest unit of data transferred over a network.  
- **Network Interface**: Software interface connecting to networking hardware.  
- **LAN**: Local Area Network, a private network.  
- **WAN**: Wide Area Network, larger than a LAN.  
- **Protocol**: A set of rules for network communication.  
- **Port**: A virtual endpoint for communication.  
- **Firewall**: Controls incoming and outgoing traffic.  
- **NAT**: Network Address Translation for routing requests.  
- **VPN**: Virtual Private Network for secure connections.  

### Network Layers

Networking is structured in layers to enable efficient communication.

#### TCP/IP Model

- **Application Layer**: Handles user data and communication.  
- **Transport Layer**: Manages process-to-process communication.  
- **Internet Layer**: Routes data between networks.  
- **Link Layer**: Manages physical network connections.  

### Interfaces

A network interface is a communication point for connecting to a network.

### Protocols

- **TCP**: Reliable, ordered data transmission.  
- **UDP**: Fast, connectionless communication.  
- **IP**: Handles routing and addressing.  
- **HTTP**: Foundation of web communication.  
- **HTTPS**: Secure version of HTTP.  
- **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.  

## Summary

By now, you should have a solid understanding of networking concepts, terminology, and protocols. This knowledge will help you better navigate advanced networking topics.
