## Introduction to Genkit

Genkit is an open-source framework designed to streamline the development of AI-infused applications. It provides tools and abstractions for working with various language models, managing prompts, and orchestrating AI flows.

### Core Concepts

*   **Flows:** Define sequences of operations, often involving LLM calls, data processing, and tool usage.
*   **Prompts:** Manage and version your prompts effectively. Genkit supports templating for dynamic prompt generation.
*   **Models:** Integrate with different AI models (e.g., Gemini) through plugins.
*   **Tools:** Allow your AI flows to interact with external systems or perform specific actions.

### Example Flow (Conceptual)

```typescript
// Conceptual Genkit flow
import { defineFlow, definePrompt } from 'genkit';
import { geminiPro } from 'genkitx/googleai'; // Fictional import

export const summarizeTextFlow = defineFlow(
  {
    name: 'summarizeText',
    inputSchema: z.string(),
    outputSchema: z.string(),
  },
  async (textToSummarize) => {
    const summaryPrompt = definePrompt({
      name: 'summaryPrompt',
      model: geminiPro,
      prompt: `Summarize the following text: ${textToSummarize}`,
    });

    const result = await summaryPrompt.generate();
    return result.text();
  }
);
```

Genkit aims to simplify the complexities of building production-ready AI applications.
